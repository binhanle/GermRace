Rules
2-4 players

Equipment: one game board, 4 germ tokens for each player, and one die.

Objective: Each player begins with their 4 germs in the Starting gut. They race to get eaten or drunk. The challenge is that germs have no legs or wings! Thus, the germs have be pooped out and then carried on a poopy hand, by a fly's leg, or in water to someone's food or drinking water. The first player to have all four germs get eaten or drunk, wins!

To start: Each player puts 4 germ tokens into the Starting gut. Roll the die, and whoever has the highest roll goes first. 

Playing a turn: Each turn a player can move a germ in the Starting gut or, if any germs are already outside of the gut, can choose to move any other of their germs outside the gut. Each player must always move a germ during his or her turn.

A player landing on a red square returns that germ to the Starting gut.  A player landing on a blue square follows the arrow to a new square.
